      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;john-zandbergen&#34;&gt;John Zandbergen&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is John. I am Dutch and from the east of the Netherlands. A very long time ago, I studied Computer Science in Enschede. Shortly after obtaining my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree, I started a computer company where our main clients were graphic artists, designers, and offset printers. We sold, installed, and maintained Apple computers, peripherals, and networks. I also created customized software for various customers, gradually including more and more websites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
