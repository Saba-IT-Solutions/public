      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have developed websites since the 1990s. My first application was an online shop for an organic farm, which was quite advanced for its time. Over the years, the digital landscape has evolved significantly, and so have my solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, the possibilities for your online presence are virtually limitless. Whether you need a dynamic blog to share regular updates, an online shop to sell your products, or a custom-built website that showcases your brand, I can help you find or build the best solution. I am proficient in developing static websites using tools like Hugo, customizing WordPress websites, or building fully custom sites from the ground up using PHP or C#. Where applicable, open-source software such as Dolibarr (ERP) or Prestashop (webshop) can be used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a hosting provider for your website or shared application can be overwhelming. With so many factors to consider, it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to navigate. I can help you choose a solution tailored to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;shared-hosting&#34;&gt;Shared Hosting&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A shared hosting environment is ideal for websites with a moderate number of daily visitors. This solution is particularly suitable for small to medium-sized businesses, providing a cost-effective and reliable option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;virtual-private-server-vps&#34;&gt;Virtual Private Server (VPS)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Virtual Private Server (VPS) may be an good choice when a bit more processing power is required. As the business expands and the number of visitors increases, a VPS can scale alongside, ensuring the web applications perform optimally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
